My interpretation of an ansible provisioned vagrant box, set up for symfony 4 development.

This is highly borrowed from the following tutorial: https://hauck.io/php-symfony-vagrant-ansible/

I needed to make some modifications to have it work with symfony 4.

The machine-only tag does not include a symfony release, while the with-symfony-skel tag does.
